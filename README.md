# AdmissionPredictor
Predicting applicant’s chance of admission in an university.
Here I am building a classification model using logistic regression estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from two exams. I have considered dummy historical [data](data.txt) from previous applicants that I am using as a training set for logistic regression.
